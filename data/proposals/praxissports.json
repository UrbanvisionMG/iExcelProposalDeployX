  "content_markdown": "# **Praxis Sports <> iExcel**\n\n## *Full-Funnel Growth & Community Proposal (SEO + Paid + Outbound + GEO)*\n\n---\n\n## **Executive Summary**\n\nPraxis Sports is a sports tech platform that simplifies scheduling, communication, and operations for clubs, academies, and teams - from youth to pro. The product is strong and the team is uniquely credible (Olympians, MLS veterans), but the **digital footprint is early-stage and fragmented**:\n\n* Organic search is thin beyond branded terms; a handful of pages drive most traffic.\n* Social channels (especially Instagram/TikTok) show promise, but content is not yet tied to a clear funnel or narrative.\n* There is **no paid acquisition** currently running.\n* Tracking, attribution, and GEO/SEO foundations can be strengthened to support scale.\n\nAt the same time, Praxis has clear strategic goals:\n\n* Tell **one coherent story** about who you are, who you serve, and why you're different.\n* Grow a **community of clubs and leaders** around that story.\n* Turn that community into a **predictable pipeline** of demos, trials, and accounts - while respecting startup budgets.\n\niExcel will act as a **performance-focused growth partner**:\n\n1. **Unify the narrative** across website, SEO, and social so Praxis feels like one clear, compelling brand.\n2. **Build the digital foundation**: on-page SEO + GEO, conversion-focused web structure, and rock-solid tracking.\n3. **Stand up first scalable acquisition engines**: bottom-of-funnel paid search, lightweight paid social, and targeted outbound (cold email + LinkedIn).\n4. **Optimize for revenue and adoption**, not vanity metrics - weekly cycles of \"what we did, what we learned, what we're doing next.\"\n\n## **What We Learned**\n\n### **Business & product**\n\n* Praxis is a **sports management platform**: scheduling, communication, operations; aimed at simplifying the chaos of youth and team sports.\n* You serve a **broad spectrum** (youth clubs, academies, schools, pro environments), but the messaging and web experience don't yet make that breadth feel coherent.\n* Praxis is **priced below many competitors**, but that advantage is not clearly or consistently communicated.\n* The **team is a moat**: co-founders with MLS experience, CRO with Olympic gold medal credentials, deep relationships in the sports ecosystem - yet this story is underused in marketing.\n\n*\"We have a very unique team… that story is not being told right now.\" - Lindsay Tarpley*\n\n### **Current marketing reality**\n\n* **Website & SEO**\n  * Small index footprint; most organic traffic is branded or near-branded.\n  * Rankings have been volatile in recent months; non-branded discovery is limited.\n  * Site structure and content are not yet mapped to how club directors, DOCs, or operations staff search (e.g., \"youth soccer scheduling software,\" \"sports management app for clubs\").\n* **Social media**\n  * Active presence on **Instagram and TikTok** with product clips, team stories, and educational posts; LinkedIn/X are earlier-stage but important for B2B buyers.\n  * Content is promising, but there's no clear bridge from **social attention → owned traffic → demo / trial.**\n* **Paid media**\n  * No live **paid search** or **paid social** campaigns; all traffic is organic or direct/referral.\n* **Measurement & infrastructure**\n  * Basic analytics exist, but **tracking is not yet treated as a growth product** (consistent event tracking, funnel views, and reporting for marketing decisions).\n\n### **Goals & constraints**\n\n* **Primary goal:** build a community and brand around Praxis while driving measurable growth in qualified demos/accounts.\n* **Timing:** align with 2026 planning; you're in a **growth stage** and starting to invest externally.\n* **Constraints:** startup budget, lean team; need a partner who can handle **strategy + execution** without heavy lift from internal staff.\n\n## **How We Can Help**\n\nIn this scope, iExcel focuses on **narrative, SEO/GEO, paid acquisition, outbound, and tracking** - all tuned to Praxis' sports audience.\n\n| Area | Finding | Opportunity (iExcel will…) |\n| ----- | ----- | ----- |\n| *Narrative & Positioning* | Strong story lives mostly in conversations and scattered social posts; \"who Praxis is for\" isn't crystal clear. | Run a **Narrative & Audience Workshop** and create a *Praxis Narrative Pack* (core story, audiences, proof points, do/don't phrases) used across site, ads, and outbound. |\n| *Website & Conversion* | Site explains features but not always outcomes; few clear \"paths\" by persona (club director, DOC, coach, admin). | Redesign key pages into **conversion-focused flows** (by persona & sport), with strong social proof, pricing clarity, and demo/trial CTAs. |\n| *Organic Search (SEO)* | Early-stage SEO footprint; limited non-branded rankings and content depth. | Use **SEO Site Optimization** to rework metadata, headers, internal links, and content on priority pages; launch a **sports-ops content hub** for high-intent keywords. |\n| *GEO (Generative Engine Optimization)* | Praxis is barely present in AI/LLM surfaces (ChatGPT, Perplexity, etc.). | Implement **GEO On-Page Updates**: JSON-LD schema, llm.txt, rich FAQs, and concise executive summaries so AI tools can confidently present Praxis as a recommended solution. |\n| *Paid Search* | No campaigns capturing \"ready to buy\" searches for sports management software. | Stand up **Google Ads + (optionally) Microsoft Ads** around bottom-of-funnel terms (e.g., \"club scheduling software,\" \"sports team management app\"), tightly mapped to new landing pages. |\n| *Paid Social* | Social activity is organic only; no scalable testing of top/mid-funnel cold audiences. | Launch **lean Meta/LinkedIn campaigns**: short video + testimonial creatives targeting club directors, coaches, and admins; retarget site visitors to drive demos. |\n| *Outbound & Community* | Community vision is strong, but outreach is fragmented across personal networks and DMs. | Build a **Praxis Outbound Engine**: lead lists of clubs/academies, cold email sequences, and LinkedIn DM playbooks to open conversations and push them toward demo. |\n| *Analytics, CRM & Reporting* | Limited, fragmented tracking; no simple way to tie channel → demo → account. | Implement **Tracking & Reporting**: GA4 + Tag Manager event map, UTM conventions, marketing dashboards, and CRM integration so every lead is traceable back to channel and campaign. |\n\n## **Tactical Plan**\n\n### **Phase 1 - Narrative, Foundations & Tracking (Weeks 1 - 4)**\n\n**1. Narrative & audience alignment**\n\n* 90-minute **Narrative & Audience Workshop** with Lindsay + key team.\n* Deliver *Praxis Narrative Pack*:\n  * 1-page positioning summary (problem → solution → who Praxis serves).\n  * Audience snapshots (youth club director, DOC, college coach, academy operations).\n  * Key proof points (team credibility, pricing advantage, product strengths).\n  * Guardrails: what to emphasize/avoid in marketing language.\n\n**2. Website / funnel baseline**\n\n* Audit current site structure, UX, and forms.\n* Map **core journeys**: first-time visitor → learn → social proof → pricing → demo/trial.\n* Identify 2 - 3 **priority landing experiences** (e.g., \"Club Ops\", \"Coaches\", \"Multi-Sport Orgs\") for redesign or refinement.\n\n**3. Tracking & data layer**\n\n* Implement / clean up **GA4 + Google Tag Manager**:\n  * Events for demo form views/submits, trial signups, pricing clicks, \"book a call\", etc.\n  * UTM standards for all channels.\n* Configure a simple **marketing performance dashboard** (Looker Studio or similar).\n\n### **Phase 2 - SEO + GEO & Site Optimization (Weeks 5 - 10)**\n\n**1. SEO Site Optimization (existing pages)**\n\n* Update titles, meta descriptions, H1s/H2s, and internal linking for:\n  * Home, Product/Features, Pricing, \"Who We Serve\", key blog posts/resources.\n* Add **FAQ sections** and structured data where appropriate.\n* Fix technical hygiene: sitemap, robots, canonical tags, core web vitals where feasible.\n\n**2. GEO (Generative Engine Optimization)**\n\n* Implement **JSON-LD schema**, llm.txt file, and concise **summary blocks** that LLMs can easily ingest.\n* Add 8 - 12 **high-quality FAQ Q&As** focused on \"what is Praxis,\" \"who uses it,\" \"how it's priced,\" etc., to improve answers in AI search.\n\n**3. Content roadmap**\n\n* Build a **6-month editorial roadmap** of high-intent topics (e.g., \"How to run a 400-team tournament without losing your mind\", \"Sports ops checklist for club admins\").\n* Ship 2 - 4 initial blog/guide pieces to start compounding organic traffic.\n\n### **Phase 3 - Paid Search & Paid Social Activation (Weeks 8 - 16)**\n\n*(Phase 3 overlaps Phase 2 intentionally.)*\n\n**1. Paid Search - Google Ads**\n\n* Research and select **bottom-of-funnel keyword clusters** around:\n  * \"sports management software\", \"youth club scheduling software\", \"team communication app\", etc.\n* Build campaigns with:\n  * 2 - 3 tightly themed ad groups per cluster.\n  * Responsive Search Ads (12 - 15 headlines, 4 descriptions) using Praxis' value props.\n  * Landing pages matched to intent and persona.\n* Implement conversion tracking to **qualified demo/trial**, not just raw form fills.\n\n**2. Paid Social - Meta & LinkedIn (lean tests)**\n\n* Create 3 - 5 **creative concepts** using existing Praxis assets (product screens, testimonials, clips from Lindsay/MLS co-founder).\n* Launch:\n  * Meta campaigns for top/mid funnel (awareness and traffic).\n  * LinkedIn campaigns targeting club executives, DOCs, operations leads.\n* Add **retargeting** (site visitors, engaged social users) to move prospects to demo.\n\n### **Phase 4 - Outbound & Community Engine (Months 4 - 6)**\n\n**1. Cold email engine**\n\n* Build or refine a **prospect list** of clubs/academies/leagues by region and sport.\n* Write 2 - 3 **cold email sequences** (3 - 5 touches each) emphasizing problems solved, social proof, and a soft CTA (\"15-minute walkthrough\").\n* Set up sending via your existing tools or a lightweight outbound platform; ensure compliance and deliverability.\n\n**2. LinkedIn community building**\n\n* Optimize **Lindsay's and other leaders' LinkedIn profiles** around Praxis narrative.\n* Create a **connection + DM playbook** targeting club and league decision-makers.\n* Repurpose top-performing TikTok/Instagram content into LinkedIn posts with more B2B framing.\n\n**3. Continuous optimization**\n\n* Weekly growth cycles: review metrics, identify top-performing channels/creatives, kill losers, and reallocate budget.\n* Quarterly planning to align with sports calendar (tryouts, tournament season, back-to-school, etc.).\n\n## **Expected Results**\n\nThese are **targets, not guarantees** - based on Praxis' current early-stage footprint, iExcel's past experience with B2B SaaS and sports, and typical benchmarks.\n\n### **Infrastructure outcomes (first 6 - 8 weeks)**\n\n* Unified **narrative and messaging** used across site, ads, and outbound.\n* GA4/Tag Manager fully capturing core events; baseline funnel visibility.\n* Priority pages optimized for SEO + GEO with improved technical hygiene.\n\n### **Traffic & visibility (first 3 - 6 months)**\n\nAssuming modest but meaningful content investment and initial paid budgets:\n\n* **Organic search**\n  * 2 - 3× increase in **non-branded organic traffic** (e.g., from low hundreds/month to mid/high hundreds).\n  * Praxis begins to appear for **sports management / club ops searches**, not just branded terms.\n* **Paid media**\n  * 1,500 - 4,000 incremental **paid clicks** over 3 months across search + social.\n  * Initial **CPCs** benchmarked and driven down via optimization.\n\n### **Pipeline & revenue signals (first 3 - 6 months)**\n\n* 30 - 80 **incremental demo/trial requests** attributable to new channels (SEO, paid, outbound).\n* Early view into **channel efficiency** (demo rate, cost per qualified lead per channel).\n* Identification of 2 - 3 **\"hero\" segments** (e.g., certain sports, club sizes, or regions) where Praxis closes deals at higher rates - informing next growth cycles.\n\n### **Brand & community**\n\n* More consistent **storytelling** about the Praxis team and mission across channels.\n* Steady growth of **email list and social audiences**, with clearer paths from social → owned assets → product exploration.\n* Praxis positioned as a **credible, modern sports ops platform** in both search results and AI-powered answers.\n\n## **Typical Engagement Timeline**\n\nAssuming kickoff in early 2026:\n\n* **Weeks 1 - 2**\n  * Narrative & Audience Workshop\n  * Analytics / tracking audit and plan\n  * Website & funnel audit\n* **Weeks 3 - 4**\n  * Narrative Pack delivered\n  * GA4 + GTM events implemented\n  * Initial site/UX adjustments on key pages\n* **Weeks 5 - 10**\n  * SEO & GEO on-page updates\n  * First content pieces live\n  * Marketing dashboard live\n* **Weeks 8 - 16**\n  * Google Ads + Meta/LinkedIn campaigns launched\n  * Retargeting set up\n  * Weekly optimization cycles begin\n* **Months 4 - 6**\n  * Outbound (cold email + LinkedIn) fully active\n  * Deeper CRO tests on site and landing pages\n  * Quarterly strategy reset and planning for next phase\n\n## **Pricing & Investment**\n\nNumbers below are **illustrative and meant to be tuned** once budgets and scope are finalized with Praxis' leadership.\n\n### **Option A - Full Growth Pod (Recommended)**\n\n**Scope**\n\n* All phases outlined above:\n  * Narrative & Audience Workshop + Narrative Pack\n  * SEO Site Optimization (core pages) + GEO implementation\n  * Google Ads + Meta/LinkedIn setup and ongoing management\n  * Outbound engine (cold email + LinkedIn playbooks)\n  * Tracking & Reporting (GA4, GTM, dashboards)\n  * Weekly working call and monthly strategic review\n\n**Investment**\n\n* **One-time Setup (first 4 - 6 weeks):** **$9,000**\n  * Narrative work, SEO/GEO setup, tracking implementation, initial campaign build.\n* **Ongoing Monthly (months 2 - 6+):** **$7,500 / month**\n  * Includes channel management, optimization, content guidance, reporting, and outbound engine upkeep.\n* **Ad Spend:** recommended starting range **$4,000 - $8,000 / month** across search + social (paid directly to platforms).\n\nTerm: initial **6-month** engagement, then month-to-month.\n\n### **Option B - Foundation + SEO/GEO Sprint (Lean Start)**\n\nFor a more conservative initial commitment focused on getting the fundamentals right.\n\n**Scope**\n\n* Narrative & Audience Workshop + Narrative Pack\n* Website funnel recommendations + light CRO updates\n* SEO & GEO on-page optimization for a defined set of priority pages (e.g., 10 - 20)\n* Tracking & Reporting implementation\n* High-level paid search plan (without full ongoing management)\n\n**Investment**\n\n* **One-time Sprint (6 - 8 weeks):** **$6,000**\n* **Optional Monthly Support (SEO + analytics + light advisory):** **$3,000 / month**\n  * Could later be upgraded into the full Growth Pod as Praxis ramps spend."
