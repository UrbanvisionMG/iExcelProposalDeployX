(JRC) and Carahsoft. With a CAGE code (103L2) and proven deployments across defense, healthcare, and industrial sectors, Raycom is positioned for significant market expansion in the rapidly growing private network space.\n\nHowever, the company faces a critical growth bottleneck: Domain Authority of just 6 (vs. industry average 30+), zero marketing automation infrastructure, and complete invisibility in organic search for high-value keywords like \"private 5G for government\" and \"mission-critical push-to-talk.\" iExcel's strategic intervention will transform this brand-reliant visibility into a scalable demand generation engine that captures non-branded search intent and nurtures enterprise prospects through complex B2B sales cycles.\n\n---\n\n## What We Learned\n\n**Executive urgency with resource constraints.** Leadership recognizes the need for data-backed digital marketing solutions; the company has technical bandwidth for implementation if properly guided, evidenced by their sophisticated product development and global deployment capabilities.\n\n**Niche market dominance potential.** Raycom operates in the specialized private 5G/LTE space with limited direct competition in social media and content marketing, creating significant opportunity to establish thought leadership and capture early-stage research queries.\n\n**Brand confusion crisis impacting credibility.** Multiple unrelated \"Raycom\" entities (UK audio equipment, Chinese security, Ghana ICT) dominate search results, potentially confusing enterprise buyers during due diligence processes critical for government contracting.\n\n**Technical excellence without digital amplification.** The company possesses patented technology, strategic partnerships, and proven deployments but lacks the digital infrastructure to scale lead generation beyond existing relationships.\n\n**Global operations with localization gaps.** Spanish content exists under /es/ directory indicating LATAM strategy, but missing hreflang implementation and proper international SEO structure limits effectiveness in target markets.\n\n**Partnership leverage opportunity.** Existing relationships with Carahsoft (DA 52) and IWCE Expo provide foundation for strategic link building and co-marketing initiatives that could rapidly improve domain authority.\n\n**Quote from industry analysis:** \"Raycom is recognized in industry reports as a key innovator in tactical and mission-critical 5G\" - SNS Telecom & IT Market Research, indicating strong product-market fit requiring digital amplification.\n\n---\n\n## What We Found\n\n| Area | Finding | Impact |\n|------|---------|--------|\n| **SEO Authority** | Domain Authority 6 vs. industry average 30+;
